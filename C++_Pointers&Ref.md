# Pointers and References 

### 1. Introduction
A major component of C++ that will be used throughout all of CS221 is the use of references and pointers. 
References and pointers both:
  * Are extremely powerful, but extremely dangerous
  * Are a **level of indirection** via memory to the data.

 As a level of indirection via memory to the data: 
   1. `*` pointer to where data is in memory
   2. `&` address to where data is being stored
