L7 - Binary Search Trees, Tree Traversals Implementation

  * Linked lists are constructed out of nodes, consisting of
    * a data element,
    * a pointer to another node

  * Lists are constructed as chains of such nodes
    * Where head points to the first item in the list (or NULL if empty)

  * Trees are also constructed from nodes
  Root points to the head of the tree
  Can traverse either left or right to children
