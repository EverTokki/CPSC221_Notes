Recap:

Pass by value ...

Why do we use the keyword const?
We want to create a copy of the object:
```
void changeRadius (const Sphere& s1)
```
We want to create a new Sphere to copy over the values

### 2. The Big Three in C++
The rule of thumb in C++ is that if a class defines any of the three functions constructtor, destructor, and copy assignment operator - then it should explicitly define all three and not rely on their default implementation.

  * Constructor: Any time we create an instance of an object
  * Destructor: Any time an object memory is being de-allocated
    * Stack: When the function returns
    * Heap: When we delete. (When you use `new`, you should use `delete`. Don't use `delete` when you haven't used `new`.)


Q: Can you use the delete keyword in another function?

```cpp
makeSphere() {
Sphere* s1 = new Sphere(4);
// This is returning a pointer to where sphere data is stored in memory.

return s1;
// We are returning the value, or 0x3000 of s1.
}
``` // !!! Graphic on handout

```cpp
Sphere *mySphere = makeSphere();

delete mySphere;
// This deletes the original Sphere data.
```

Copy assignment operator:

**CustomArray.h**
```cpp
class Array {
	private:
		int size; // This is the size of the memory
		int* vals; // Pointing to where the array is stored

	public:
		~Array(); // Destructor in C++
		Array (int s, int* v);
}
```
